# AutoTyper
Simple clipboard auto typer

## How it works
The executable will wait two seconds after launch and starts typing the content from clipboard.
After launching the tool, select the window of choice and place the cursor.

## Usage
There are multiple ways to use this tool in a smart way. I guess the best way is to assign the executable to a keyboard macro which is supported by nearly every major keyboard manufacturer.<br>
However you can also place the executable somewhere in your file system and drag it into the taskbar or symbolic link it to the desktop.

## config file
The configuration is stored in the settings.conf file, which will be created at first launch.
Please pay attention to the syntax and only use the provided options and format!
